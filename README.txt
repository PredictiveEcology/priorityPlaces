This project aims to support the multi-species planning objectives of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) with respect to cumulative effects management, and Species at Risk (woodland caribou and migratory boreal songbirds) recovery, under anticipated land use and climate change. The project builds off of previous work - Simulation effects of climate change on fire regime: implications for boreal caribou and landbird communities in the Northwest Territories (Micheletti et al., 2019) -- through an extension identifying areas of multi-species diversity for conservation consideration, which we term a “priority place”. 

The project team consists of a diverse group of individuals across multiple government, private, and academic sectors, each representing international expertise in proposal components. Together, within the SpaDES framework (McIntire and Chubaty, 2019), we are able to integrate our areas of expertise to provide a cohesive and complementary ecosystem of models for dynamic cumulative effects forecasting in Canada.  This work represents the third report within a collaboration between the SpaDES integrative modeling philosophy (McIntire et al., 2018) and ECCC; it represents, to our knowledge, the first dynamic, open source, and adaptable integrative modeling platform for ecological forecasts of multi-species priority conservation locations at the extent of Canada’s Taiga Plains, Northwest Territories.

The models contained within this project represent regional processes and are intended to support regional planning initiatives. The models incorporate the best current understanding of ecological processes, and make use of statistical relationships at regional and national scales. They may not accurately predict localized processes. Accordingly, the results should not be taken as predictions of the conditions at any particular location and time. This discrepancy between regional and local scales is well documented in ecology (Holling, 1992; Levin, 1992; Wiens, 1989) with direct ramifications on downscaling models (Araújo et al., 2005; Riitters, 2005). 

We are currently implementing upgrades to this version, which will contain fully climate sensitive wildfire simulation models, as well as improved bird models with the inclusion of climate covariates, and improved vegetation succession simulation models with the development of the species parametrization models.
